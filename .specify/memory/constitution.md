# Project Constitution: AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation — Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Versioning & Dates
- **Constitution Version:** 1.0.0
- **Ratification Date:** 2025-12-07
- **Last Amended Date:** 2025-12-07

## Workflow Tools
Docusaurus • GitHub Pages • Spec-Kit Plus • Claude Code • MCP

## Core Principles

### Embodied Intelligence (Conceptual)
Focus on Physical AI principles and digital-to-physical workflows, explained in theory and simulation

### High-Fidelity Simulation (Educational)
Explain Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac pipelines for learning purposes

### Humanoid Control Systems (Software Only)
ROS 2 control pipelines explained conceptually; no hardware manipulation

### Safety & Reliability (Educational Focus)
Teach safety concepts, sensor feedback loops, and correct ROS 2 practices

### Accuracy & Evidence-Based Design
Claims backed by peer-reviewed research, robotics standards, or manufacturer documentation

### Clarity for Technical Audience
Designed for CS, Mechatronics, and Robotics learners

### Reproducibility & Rigor
Follow Spec-Kit Plus style; examples reproducible in simulation

### Automation-First Workflow
Claude Code for MDX generation, code cleanup, and refactoring

### Documentation Correctness
MCP ensures references to Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, and academic sources are precise

## Writing & Research Standards

- Minimum 50% peer-reviewed sources
- APA 7th edition citations
- Flesch-Kincaid grade 10–12 readability
- Zero plagiarism tolerance
- MDX content must follow Spec-Kit Plus

## Technical & Workflow Constraints

- Markdown/MDX format; full Docusaurus structure
- Docusaurus build must succeed without warnings
- Continuous deployment to GitHub Pages
- MCP validation for Docusaurus config files and deployment references
- Conventional commits required for all changes

## Content Constraints

- 5,000–7,000 words (excluding diagrams/code)
- Minimum 15 credible sources
- Diagrams & code must be educational and reproducible: Mermaid, MDX, or SVG

## Deliverables

- Docusaurus website (textbook)
- PDF export with citations
- Structured /docs directory

## Process Rules

- Use /sp.chapter for chapters
- Use /sp.section for subsections
- Iterative validation via MCP and Spec-Kit Plus
- All examples and workflows documented for learning purposes

## Success Criteria

- Technical claims verified & traceable in educational examples
- Docusaurus configs correct
- Zero plagiarism
- Reproducible simulations and ROS 2 workflows explained conceptually
- High-fidelity simulations align with book examples

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
This constitution may be amended by a proposal, discussion, and consensus among project stakeholders. Significant changes will require explicit approval from the project lead.

### Versioning Policy
Constitution versions follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR:** Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
- **MINOR:** New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
- **PATCH:** Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.

### Compliance Review
The project constitution will be reviewed annually to ensure its continued relevance and adherence to project goals and external standards.
